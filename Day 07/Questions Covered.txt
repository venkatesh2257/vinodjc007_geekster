1. Take in a character as a character input from the user, and print “You are a male” if
‘M’ or ‘m’ is taken as input. And print “You are a female” if ‘F’ or ‘f’ is taken as
input. And if some other character is taken as an input, then print “Type again”.

2. You will be given two strings as input in two separate lines, you need to simply
concatenate them and print the resulting string.

3. Given 2 strings, a and b, return a string of the form short+long+short, with the
shorter string on the outside and the longer string on the inside. The strings will not be
the same length, but they may be empty (length 0).
For eg. Example 1 - comboString("Hello", "hi") → "hiHellohi"
Example 2 - comboString("hi", "Hello") → "hiHellohi"
Example 3 - comboString("aaa", "b") → "baaab"
